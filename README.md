# Grid_And_X_Project.game
 Dynamic grid, when clicked on sprite changes to X, if 3 X's match goes back.
 
 Hello everyone, hope you are well.
 
 I've done this project as a case study for an internship at a game company.
 
 A grid of m x n, where m and n are public integers and can be changed,
 when clicked on an individual blue tile it turns into an X tile.
 If 3 or more X tiles are matched, it goes back to being blue tile.
 All done through changing sprites.
 
 I have never worked with grids before.
 
 This grid with X's is not perfect of course, in some specific cases it may not work.
 However I've learnt a lot.
 
 I will definitely be working with grid based systems in the future.
